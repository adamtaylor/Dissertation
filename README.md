# Analysis of Web Application Vulnerability Detection Algorithms

This is my dissertation.  I don't imagine you're interested in it (it's about automated detection of web application vulnerabilities by the way) but you're welcome to check out my report/paper.  It's written in LaTeX so you'll have to compile it using pdf2latex or something similar.

There's no code for you because I believe it's (c) Durham University (even though I wrote it all myself!).

Have a nice day!
